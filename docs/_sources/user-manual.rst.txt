User Manual
*********************

Introduction
================

This is the Operation Manual for Quick Scan. Here you will find detailed information 
about all the features and functions in the program.

Platform-Independent Documentation
-----------------------------------------

The documentation applies to the operating systems Windows and macOS.
Features and settings that are specific to one of these platforms are clearly indicated. In all other 
cases, the descriptions and procedures in the documentation are valid for Windows and macOS.
One point to consider:
- The screenshots are taken from Windows.

Set-up
================

For this utility to work you will need the following:

- A camara (or web-cam)
- A microphone

Also, you need to ensure to have their drivers properly set up before initializing the application.

Loading / Creating a project
================================

To create a project you will need to (in no-particular order):

- chose a location for it
- give it a name
- set up the drivers and devices you want to use for data acquisition
- Choose the range to perform the **spectrum analysis**

From the same screen you can open a project, just navigate to its folder, and load the `.pro` file.

** Frequency range influences the minimum time of recording per cell in the **Grid System**.

Calibrating the Equipment
================================

Microphone
--------------------

If you use an external audio interface, ensure the gain is set up properly, following the guidelines from each manufacturer. If you decide to connect the microphone directly to the jack in the PC or through the USB, ensure, through the driver that the input signal is at healthy levels.

Camera
--------------------

Camera-wise, you will only need to white-balance the image, if the camera allows for it. To prove optimal image quality, use artificial light if natural is not available or scarce.
